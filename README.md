# ðŸ§  Modular LLM Architecture with Pluggable Reasoning Heads

A scalable and interpretable framework that enhances a frozen base language model (LLM) with **modular reasoning capabilities** using attachable **pluggable heads** for symbolic, logical, graph-based, or multimodal reasoning tasks.

## Overview

This project introduces a **controller-based architecture** where different reasoning modules ("heads") can be attached to a frozen LLM. Depending on the input type or intent, the controller routes the prompt to the appropriate reasoning head.

### Key Features
- Pluggable reasoning heads (e.g., Symbolic, Logical, Graph-based)
- Controller model for dynamic routing
- Frozen base LLM (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-2) for core generation
- Modular design with minimal retraining required
- Explainable reasoning path (transparent routing logic)

## Architecture

The system is built around a modular plug-and-play design that routes user prompts to specialized reasoning heads. A Controller Module interprets the prompt and dispatches it to the most appropriate reasoning head (e.g., symbolic, logical, or graph-based). The selected head performs reasoning, possibly augmenting or guiding a frozen base LLM to produce accurate and explainable results.

## Reasoning Heads (Implemented)
 Symbolic â€“ algebraic simplification, rule-based logic using SymPy

 Logical â€“ Prolog-style query resolution

 Graph-based â€“ node/edge reasoning using GNN or embeddings

 More coming soon...


## Demo (Coming Soon)
A Gradio demo will be added for interactive testing.
